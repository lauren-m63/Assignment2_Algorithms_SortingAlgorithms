so based on the O(..) here is what I think will be slow

1. bubble sort because it is double nested loop which i am always using so this is O(n^2) runtime and quite slow
    // also it is comparing them all to each other no matter what i think so it is always doing that and never gets better

2. insertion sort- starts from the second and compares backwards so goes through the whole list

3. selection sort - where it looks for small and swaps with first , so its always comparing all of them too so maybe above bubble but if its already sorted then ur jsut looking at not doing anythig,
                        but that would make it 1 anyway with the swapping so not sure that matters. it says selection is better than bubble actually so yes
    // i think all of the above will be relativley equally slow because they are all the same runtime of n^2 because of the multi loop vibe
    // im also writing this after testing and these ones are so slow so i kind of know, sorry im out of order lol

4. quick sort (O n log n) so should this be above shell yes
5. shell sort = not n^2 and it is n log n ? it says ish

6. merge sort
    // quick sort and merge sort are both O(n log n) but it says that merge sort is always that where the quick has a worst case o f n^2 so maybe that is above shell?
    - merge should be last
