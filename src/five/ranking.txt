so based on the O(..) here is what I think will be slow

1. bubble sort because it is double nested loop which i am always using so this is O(n^2) runtime and quite slow
2. insertion sort
3. selection sort
// i think all of the above will be relativley equally slow because they are all the same runtime of n^2 because of the multi loop vibe

4.

6. merge sort
// quick sort and merge sort are both O(n log n) but it says that merge sort is always that where the quick has a worst case o f n^2 so maybe that is above shell?
- merge should be last
